## Abstract

As computer science and engineering programs continue to grow in enrollment, automatic assessment tools have become prevalent. Manual assessment of programming exercises can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, creating a need for such tools. In response, this paper proposes a tool to assess assembly exercises, specifically ARM64 programs, and provide real-time feedback to students. The tool includes features for evaluating, analyzing, and detecting plagiarism in student submissions. After two years of intensive usage in a higher education environment, the results and analysis show a positive impact and potential benefits for teachers and students. Furthermore, the tool’s source code is publicly available, making it a valuable contribution to building more effective and efficient automatic assessment tools for computer science and engineering schools.

## My experience at ICSOFT 2023

During the conference, I had the pleasure of connecting with brilliant individuals from diverse backgrounds, engaging in meaningful discussions, and receiving valuable feedback on the innovative work we have been developing. The experience was truly enriching, broadening my perspective and inspiring me to push the boundaries of my research interests even further. I had the opportunity to present my work to a large audience and receive insightful questions and feedback.

After this conference, my work at the University of Porto comes to an end after two and a half years of researching and developing this tool. I am proud of the work I have done and the impact it has had on the students and teachers who have used it. I am also grateful for the this opportunity and for the support of my supervisor, Professor Bruno Lima, and the University of Porto.
